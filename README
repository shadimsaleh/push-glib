                  Push-GLib - Push Notifications for GLib
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the ability to send push notifications to various
mobile devices. Currently supported is Apple's Push Notification service and
Google's C2DM as used by Android.

The API will likely churn a lot until a good design is proved.
